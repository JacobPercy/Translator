# Translator

## About the project:

To learn how to better use tkinter, I made this bare bones translator to test out some features

## Installation instructions:
```
#run the following commands
git clone https://github.com/JacobPercy/Translator.git
cd Translator
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 -u main.py # to run the app
```

## How to use:

Once the program is launched, all you have to do is type input in the top and the language you want to use in the second box, and either hit "enter" or the "translate" button to get a result in the third box on the bottom of the screen. You can copy the output (or the input) by clicking the "copy" button corrosponding to the side that you want to get the information from. Additionally, you can swap the two sides with the "swap" button. To close the program, click the "X" button in the top right.

The program uses "translators" API to get translation data and currently uses the two-character abbreviations of language names, but in the future I plan to fix this and add compatibility to the use of the actual names. 

## Quick note:

This really isn't thank useful as google translate has the same functionality as this but is faster and more accesable. One of the main reasons this is even a public thing is so I can share it to people easier and I kind of just didn't want to put this whole "README" to waste so here you go.
